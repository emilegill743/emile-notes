##### Supervised Learning with scikit-learn #####

'''Supervised Learning'''

    # Machine Learning

        # Giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data,
        # without being explicitly programmed

        # Examples
            # Learning to predict whether an email is spam ir not
            # Clustering wikipedia entries into different categories

        # Supervised Learning - Uses labelled data

        # Unsupervised Learning - Uses unlabelled data

            # Uncovering hidden patterns and structures from unlabelled data
            
            # Example - grouping customers into distinct catrgories (Clustering)
        
        # Reinforcement Learning

            # Software agents interact with an environment
                # Learn how to optimise behaviour
                # Given system of rewards and punishments
