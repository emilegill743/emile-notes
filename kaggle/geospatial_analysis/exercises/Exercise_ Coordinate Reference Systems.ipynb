In your research, you discover that these birds typically spend the summer breeding season in the eastern United States, and then migrate to South America for the winter.  But since this bird is under threat of endangerment, you'd like to take a closer look at the locations that these birds are more likely to visit.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qQcS0KM.png\" width=\"1000\"><br/>\n</center>\n\nThere are several [protected areas](https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/about) in South America, which operate under special regulations to ensure that species that migrate (or live) there have the best opportunity to thrive.
