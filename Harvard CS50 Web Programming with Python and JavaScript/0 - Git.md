## Git

> Git is a version control system which can be used to keep track of changes to code, synchronise code between different people, test changes to code without losing the original, and revert back to old versions of code.

### Git Commands

 ```git clone <url>``` : Takes a repository stored on a server (such as GitHub) and downloads it.

 ```git add <filename(s)>``` : Add files to staging area to be included in next commit.

 ```git commit -m "message"``` : Take a snapshot of the repository and save it with a message about the changes.

 ```git commit -am <filename(s)> "message"``` : Add files to staging area and commit all in one.
