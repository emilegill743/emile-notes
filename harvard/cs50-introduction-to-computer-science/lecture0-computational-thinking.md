## Binary

>**Binary** -  Numerical system in which there are just two digits, 0 and 1.

e.g. 123 --> 1111011

| 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
| -- | -- | -- | - | - | - | - |
| 1  | 1  |  1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

Computers use transistors- switches that can store electricity, representing "on"/"off"- to store binary data as **bits** (binary digits).
8 bits make up one **byte**.

## Representing data

> **ASCII** - Standard mapping of letters to numeric values.

e.g. 65 --> "A", 66-->"B"

> **Unicode** - Standard mapping including additional characters such as accented letters, emojis.

e.g. 128514 --> "laughing face emoji"

> **RGB** - Images are composed of pixels, each having a color determined by a triplet of values corresponding to the respective mix of red, blue and green.

## Algorithms

> **Algorithm** - Step-by-step instructions for solving a problem

Different algorithms will scale with different efficiencies as the size of the problem increases.
